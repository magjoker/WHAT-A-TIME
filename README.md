## Description
This app is a CLI or Command Line Interface. <br>
The way I use it in this app is to collect employee data and generate an HTML page displaying the collected data. <br>
If you want to use it follow these steps. <br>
 - clone the repo onto your machine.
 - open the application in an IDE like VS code. 
 - open the command line on the root directory
 - type "node index" (omit the quotes)
 - answer the questions it will provide.
 - after that your file is generated!
Watch me demo the app here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QsOGPy-cBKUG44hCYzlLRun2iCuM21VF/view
